1. To configure load balancer do we have the same type of instances? 
	or is that okay if it is is different?
2. Can we use the same key pair to multiple instances?
3. While creating load balancer, we have to select the security groups? If we are launching
	4 instances then do we need to select all 4 security groups of those 4 instances or any
	one is enough?
